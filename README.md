InfiniQuest
===========

Imagine a world that is randomly generated on the fly, inhabited by all manner of creatures both friendly and hostile.
Now imagine that some of these creatures need your help and each time you play you will have new objectives.
Imagine that your actions will help shape the world and may influence the lives of all the creatures in it.

Also imagine that the developer of this game does not have amazing godlike animation and graphics skills and that maybe he will be working with sprites.

You have just imagined InfiniQuest. Stop imagining and shape your own destiny!
